# üìö Question Management Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide shows you how to add questions to the database **without changing any code**. The system uses JSON files to store questions, making it easy to manage and expand your question bank.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Admin Interface (Easiest)
```bash
python question_admin.py
```
This opens an interactive menu where you can:
- Add single questions
- Import questions from JSON files
- View statistics
- Export questions

### Method 2: Programmatic Addition
```python
from question_database import add_maths_question

# Add a single question
add_maths_question(
    topic="place_value",
    year_group="Year 3", 
    difficulty="Medium",
    question_text="What is the value of the hundreds digit in 456?",
    options=["4", "5", "6", "400"],
    correct_answer="4",
    explanation="In 456, the hundreds digit is 4."
)
```

### Method 3: Bulk Import from JSON
Create a JSON file like `my_questions.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "subject": "maths",
    "topic": "place_value",
    "year_group": "Year 2",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "What is the value of the tens digit in 34?",
    "options": ["3", "4", "30", "40"],
    "correct_answer": "3",
    "explanation": "In 34, the tens digit is 3."
  }
]
```

Then import it using the admin interface.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
KidsPracticePDF/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_data/              # Questions stored here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ maths_questions.json    # Maths questions

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ question_admin.py          # Admin interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_questions.json      # Example format
```

## üé® Question Format

Each question has this structure:
```json
{
  "question": "What is 2 + 3?",
  "options": ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
  "correct_answer": "5",
  "explanation": "2 + 3 = 5"
}
```

count = db.get_question_count("maths", "place_value", "Year 3", "Medium")
print(f"Available questions: {count}")
```

### Export All Questions
```python

export_questions()  # This will prompt for filename
```

## üìã Best Practices

### 1. Question Writing
- Keep questions clear and age-appropriate
- Ensure all options are plausible
- Provide clear explanations
- Follow UK curriculum guidelines

### 2. Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Basic concepts, simple calculations
- **Medium**: More complex problems, multiple steps
- **Hard**: Advanced concepts, problem-solving

### 3. Year Group Progression
- **Year 1-2**: Numbers to 100, basic operations
- **Year 3-4**: Numbers to 1000, multiplication tables
- **Year 5-6**: Larger numbers, complex operations

### 4. File Management
- Keep JSON files well-organized
- Use descriptive filenames
- Backup your question files regularly
- Validate JSON syntax before importing

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Question not appearing**
- Check the subject/topic spelling
- Verify year group and difficulty match exactly
- Ensure JSON syntax is correct

**2. Import errors**
- Validate JSON format using online tools
- Check file encoding (should be UTF-8)
- Ensure all required fields are present

**3. Duplicate questions**
- The system allows duplicates
- Use the admin interface to view existing questions
- Consider adding unique identifiers if needed

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Question text is clear and complete
- [ ] Exactly 4 options provided
- [ ] Correct answer matches one of the options
- [ ] Explanation is helpful and accurate
- [ ] Subject and topic names are correct
- [ ] Year group and difficulty are valid
- [ ] JSON syntax is correct

## üîÑ Integration with Main App

The question database automatically integrates with the main application. When you add questions:

1. They're saved to JSON files in `question_data/`
2. The main app loads them automatically
3. No code changes needed in `app.py` or `question_bank.py`
4. Questions appear immediately in the web interface

## üìà Scaling Up

### For Large Question Banks
1. **Organize by subject**: Create separate JSON files for each subject
2. **Use bulk imports**: Prepare questions in Excel/Google Sheets, export as JSON
3. **Version control**: Keep question files in Git for tracking changes
4. **Backup regularly**: Questions are valuable - back them up!

### For Teams
1. **Shared templates**: Use the provided JSON templates
2. **Review process**: Have questions reviewed before adding
3. **Quality control**: Regular audits of question quality
4. **Documentation**: Keep notes on question sources and curriculum alignment

## üéâ Success Tips

1. **Start small**: Add a few questions and test them
2. **Use the admin interface**: It's designed to be user-friendly
3. **Follow the format**: Use the provided templates and examples
4. **Test regularly**: Generate worksheets to check question quality
5. **Get feedback**: Ask teachers and students for input
