## 💡 **Cost Optimization Strategies**

### **1. PDF Compression**
```python
# Reduce PDF size by 60-80%
# Original: 1MB → Compressed: 200-400KB
# Cost savings: 60-80% reduction

def compress_pdf(file_path):
    # Use gzip compression
    # Optimize images
    # Remove unnecessary metadata
    return compressed_file
```

### **2. Aggressive Cleanup**
```python
# Delete old PDFs after 7 days
# Keep only essential files
# Reduce storage costs by 90%

def cleanup_old_files():
    # Delete files older than 7 days
    # Keep only answer keys for 30 days
    # Archive old questions
```

### **3. Smart Caching**
```python
# Cache frequently accessed PDFs
# Reduce R2 read operations
# Use browser caching

# Cache strategy:
# - Hot PDFs: Keep in memory
# - Warm PDFs: Keep in R2
# - Cold PDFs: Delete after 7 days
```

## 🔄 **Alternative Storage Options**

### **Option 1: Local Storage Only**
```bash
# Store PDFs locally on Oracle VM
# Pros: £0 storage cost
# Cons: Limited by 200GB storage, no CDN
# Best for: <10,000 users
```

### **Option 2: Hybrid Approach**
```bash
# Hot files: Local storage
# Cold files: R2 storage
# Pros: Optimized costs
# Cons: More complex
# Best for: 10,000-100,000 users
```

### **Option 3: R2 Only**
```bash
# All files in R2
# Pros: Unlimited storage, global CDN
# Cons: Small cost for high usage
# Best for: >100,000 users
```
